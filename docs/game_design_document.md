### Game Overview
**Game Concept**: An interactive piano learning application that teaches users to play the piano through guided lessons, focusing on scales, modes, chords, and chord inversions with proper fingerings and timing.

**Target Audience**: Beginners to intermediate piano players, including those interested in self-teaching, music students, and hobbyists.

### Core Gameplay Mechanics
- Interactive lessons guiding users through various piano exercises.
- Real-time feedback based on user input.
- Progressive difficulty adjustment based on user proficiency.

### Core learning goals

Players should learn the spatial patterns of the piano such as scales, modes, chords, and chord inversions. They should also gain knowledge of the notes that comprise key signatures, scales, and chords. When successful, players should have a tacit knowledge and muscle memory of the previous concepts.

### LessonDisplay Feature
**Objective**: To guide players through piano exercises by visually indicating the next key to play along with the appropriate finger number.

#### Key Components:
- **Interactive Guidance**: The system displays the next key and finger number, pausing and waiting for the user to play the correct key.
- **Synchronization**: Seamless coordination between visual cues (notes and fingerings) and user input.
- **Exercise Preview**: An option to preview the exercise, demonstrating the correct sequence of notes and timings.
- **Tempo Control**: Adjustable tempo settings to cater to different proficiency levels.

#### Implementation Strategy:
- **Lesson Logic**: Script containing note sequences, fingerings, and timing for each lesson.
- **Communication**: Using Godot signals for inter-component communication.
- **User Input and Validation**: Listening to user input for correctness and timing.
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators on the piano keys for the next note in the sequence.

### User Interface and Experience
- **Lesson Selection**: A user-friendly interface for selecting different lessons and exercises.
- **Settings**: Options for users to adjust tempo and view their progress.
- **Feedback System**: Visual and auditory feedback to guide and correct users during lessons.

### Audio and Visuals
- **Sound**: Realistic piano sounds for both user input and exercise previews.
- **Graphics**: A clean and intuitive layout displaying the piano and note information.

### Technical Requirements
- **Platform**: [Specify target platforms - PC, mobile, etc.]
- **Engine**: Developed using Godot Engine.
- **MIDI Integration**: Support for MIDI keyboards for input.

### Future Development Plans
- **Content Expansion**: Adding more lessons covering advanced topics.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Algorithmically adjusting the difficulty based on user performance.
- **Social Features**: Options for users to share their progress or performances.

### Appendix and References
- **Reference Materials**: Links to music theory resources, piano tutorials, etc.
